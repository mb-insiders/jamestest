The purpose of this project is to provide insight into the abilities
and motivations of the test subject. This project is expected to take 
no longer than 48 hours and be completed using Flutter.

The following screen is a design from our mobile application with a basic example
of a twitter-like social media post list. The data provided in this same is mocked and 
the screen it's self was designed by our UI/UX specialist and built and implemented by 
an engineering intern.


## Goal:



Packages to use:
```
flutter_phosphor_icons: ^any
```
Build the mobile screen presented above and make it look and feel 1:1 with the design. 
This design was a screenshot of the actual implementation currently live on our app.
